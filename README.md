# Group-Chat-Application
It all started with figuring out a way to chat with friends during lab practicals and lectures, as Whatsapp web was not accessible on the college WiFi and using mobile phones resulted in a harsh fine of Rs2000, and I ended up building this Group Chat Application. The application follows a Client-Server architecture and utilizes TCP protocol to guarantee every message reaches the server and then to the specified user. The best thing about this application is that any laptop can act as a server so there is no need to deploy an external server. Python3 along with its various libraries, Tkinter(for the GUI) and Socket programming were employed for the development of this project.
